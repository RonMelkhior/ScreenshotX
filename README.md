## ScreenshotX

ScreenshotX is a small PHP project by me in order to be able to upload my screenshots to my own domain via ShareX.

## Installation

In order to install ScreenshotX, first upload the php file to the folder you'd like to upload your files into.
Once you have done that, configure ScreenshotX to your liking via the config located at the top of the code.
Now, in ShareX:

1. Pick Destinations and choose Destination Settings.
2. In the bottom, pick Custom uploaders.
3. Set Request type to POST.
4. Link to the PHP file in Request URL.
5. In File form name, type whatever you have chosen for $fileFormName.
6. Create a new Argument, with Name as $argumentName and Value as $argumentValue.
7. Now test to check if everything works.
